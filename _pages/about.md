Hi! I am Shengjie Luo (ÁΩóËÉúÊù∞), a fourth-year Ph.D. student at School of Intelligence Science and Technology in Peking University, advised by [Prof.Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/) and [Prof.Di He](https://dihe-pku.github.io/). Before that, I finished my undergraduate study at ShenYuan Honors College in Beihang University, majoring in Computer Science. I have been a research intern at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/).

My main research area lies in machine learning, with special interests in models and algorithms inspired by theoretical insights. Recently, my works focus on representation learning on structured data (e.g., graphs and sequences) and provide comprehensive analysis on foundational architectures (Transformers, GNNs) covering their expressiveness, efficiency and effectiveness, as well as apply them to AI for Science, Graph Learning and Natural Language Processing. I have published several papers and been reviewers at the top machine learning and artificial intelligence conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML and ICLR.

If you are interested in collaborating with me or want to have a chat, always feel free to contact me through e-mail or WeChat :)

[**ICLR 2024 <font color="#DC143C">Spotlight (top 4.96%)</font>**] [Enabling Efficient Equivariant Operations in the Fourier Basis via Gaunt Tensor Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10216)

**Shengjie Luo**\*, Tianlang Chen\*, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan

[**[Project]**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=mhyQXJ6JsK) [**[Code]**](https://github.com/lsj2408/Gaunt-Tensor-Product) 
- We develop a brandly new and systematic method to substantially improve the efficiency of the mainstream E(3) equivariant operations, tensor product of irreps, opening up a new opportunity to pushing the frontier of Geometric Deep Learning and its application in Science.
- A new perspective: we reveal the relationship between Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and Gaunt coefficients spherical harmonics, connecting tensor product of Gaunt coefficients with integrals of products between three spherical functions.
- A new opportunity: instead of using spherical harmonics, products between spherical functions expressed as 2D Fourier Basis can be accelerated.
- We introduce Gaunt Tensor Product, a principled approach to accelerate Tensor Product of Irreps, the complexity of which is reduced to just O(L^3) instead of O(L^6).
- Our method opens up a new pathway for revolutionizing modern E(3) Equivariant Neural Networks, and extensive experiments further demonstrate the efficiency and generality of our Gaunt Tensor Product approach.

Tianlang Chen\*, **Shengjie Luo**\*‚Ä†, Di He, Shuxin Zheng, Tie-Yan Liu, Liwei Wang

[**[Project]**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xLRAQiqd9I) [**[Code]**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xLRAQiqd9I) 
- We develop a Transformer-based Geometric Molecular model called GeoMFormer, which can effectively perform both invariant and equivariant prediction with strong performance
at the same time.
- By allowing simultaneously and completely modeling interatomic interactions within/across feature spaces in a unified manner, GeoMFormer achieved strong performance covering diverse data modalities, scales and tasks with both invariant and equivariant targets, opening up a new pathway towards scientific AI generalist.

[**ICML 2024**] [Two Stones Hit One Bird: Bilevel Positional Encoding for Better Length Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16421)

Zhenyu He\*, Guhao Feng\*, **Shengjie Luo**\*, Kai Yang, Liwei Wang, Jingjing Xu, Zhi Zhang, Hongxia Yang, Di He

[**[Project]**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16421) [**[Code]**](https://github.com/zhenyuhe00/BiPE) 
- We develop a bilevel positional encoding, which has superior length extrapolation capabilities across diverse text modalities and tasks.
- Leveraging the intrinsic segmentation of language sequences, our BiPE blends an intra-segment encoding and an inter-segment encoding.
- The intra-segment encoding identifies the locations within a segment and helps the model capture the semantic information therein via absolute PE.
- The inter-segment encoding specifies the segment index, models the relationships between segments, and aims to improve extrapolation capabilities via relative PE.

Bohang Zhang\*, **Shengjie Luo**\*, Liwei Wang, Di He

[**[Project]**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r9hNv76KoT3) [**[Code]**](https://github.com/lsj2408/Graphormer-GD)
- Beyond the WL test, we propose a fundamentally different perspective, a novel class of expressivity metrics via üöÄ**Graph Biconnectivity**üöÄ, to study the expressive power of GNNs.
- Through the lens of graph biconnectivity, we systematically investigate popular GNNs including classic MPNNs, Graph Substructure Networks (GSN) and its
variant, GNN with lifting transformations (MPSN and CWN), GraphSNN, and Subgraph GNNs. The thorough analysis provide a fine-grained understanding on the expressive power of existing GNNs.
- Based on the above theoretical analysis, we develop a principled and more efficient approach, called the Generalized Distance Weisfeiler-Lehman (GD-WL), which is provably expressive for all biconnectivity metrics. 
- We further develop Graphormer-GD to implement the GD-WL, which is a Transformer-like architecture that preserves expressiveness and enjoys full parallelizability.

[**ICLR 2023**] [One Transformer Can Understand Both 2D & 3D Molecular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01765)

**Shengjie Luo**, Tianlang Chen\*, Yixian Xu\*, Shuxin Zheng, Tie-Yan Liu, Liwei Wang, Di He

[**[Project]**](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/lsc/leaderboards/#pcqm4mv2) [**[Code]**](https://github.com/lsj2408/Transformer-M) [![PWC](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://paperswithcode.com/badge/one-transformer-can-understand-both-2d-3d/graph-regression-on-pcqm4mv2-lsc)](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/graph-regression-on-pcqm4mv2-lsc?p=one-transformer-can-understand-both-2d-3d)
- We develop a novel Transformer-based Molecular model called Transformer-M, which can take molecular data of 2D or 3D formats as input and generate meaningful semantic representations.
- Using the standard Transformer as the backbone architecture, Transformer-M develops two separated channels to encode 2D and 3D structural information and incorporate them with the atom features in the network modules. When the input data is in a particular format, the corresponding channel will be activated, and the other will be disabled.
- We conduct extensive experiments to show that Transformer-M can simultaneously achieve strong performance on 2D and 3D tasks (PCQM4Mv2 (2D), PDBBind (2D+3D), QM9 (3D)), suggesting its broad applicability.
- üöÄ Transformer-M has been used by **all Top-3 winners** in [**PCQM4Mv2 Track, 2nd OGB Large-Scale Challenge, NeurIPS 2022**](https://ogb.stanford.edu/neurips2022/results/#winners_pcqm4mv2)!

- We mathematically analyze the expressive power of RPE-based Transformers, and show that they are not universal approximators of continuous sequence-to-sequence functions.
- We then present sufficient conditions for RPE-based Transformers to achieve universal function approximation. With the theoretical guidance, we develop Universal RPE-based (URPE) Attention, which is easy to implement and parameter-efficient.
- Our URPE-based Transformers are verified to be universal approximators from both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments including synthetic tasks, language modeling and graph learning.

- We propose a novel way to accelerate attention calculation (O(nlog(n)) for Transformers with RPE on top of the kernelized attention.
- We mathematically show that kernelized attention with RPE can be calculated efficiently using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), based on the Toeplitz matrix form of RPE.
- We further demonstrate that properly using RPE can mitigate the training instability problem of vanilla kernelized attention.
- Extensive experiments covering language pre-training, language modeling, Image Classification and Machine Translation are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our model.

- We theoretically study the preconditioning effect of normalization methods on GNN training, and empirically observe that the batch noise of graph data is larger than data from other domain, e.g. image data.
- We further show that the shift operation in InstanceNorm can cause expressiveness degradation of GNNs for highly regular graphs.
- Based on these findings, we propose a principled normalization scheme, GraphNorm, and demonstrate its acceleration effect on graph learning benchmarks.
